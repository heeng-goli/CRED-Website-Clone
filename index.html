                live by this virtue: the trustworthy. <br> <br>

                <p2>so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for <br> doing good and being
                    trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue <br> becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should
                    be. then we <br> went one step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right <br> track because
